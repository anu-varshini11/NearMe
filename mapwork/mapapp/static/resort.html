            Adhvasaha is derived from Sanskrit. 
            The name salutes the first visitors to the island, be it the Sri Ram bhakt Hanuman, the endemic tribes, or even the freedom fighters who were exiled here to the infamous Cellular Jail.
            Adhvasaha is a tribute to them, beckoning holidaymakers to come and explore the unique beauty of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. 
            As one of the few resorts in this archipelago, Adhvasaha is sure to offer an unforgettable vacation experience.
